                            <p>There are times when specialists, urgent care, or hospital-based care are needed, and I'll help guide you through that when appropriate. Staywell serves as your main point of contact and advocate within the healthcare system.</p>

                            <p>Concierge medicine and direct primary care both focus on access and relationship-based care, but the models are structured differently.</p>
                            <p>Concierge practices are often significantly more expensive and many still bill insurance on top of a membership fee, which increases overhead and administrative complexity.</p>
                            <p>Staywell Health is a direct primary care practice. We do not bill insurance, which keeps overhead low and allows more time for care. Those savings are passed on to members through more affordable pricing, longer visits, and personalized care. The focus is simplicity and quality, not luxury perks.</p>

                            <p>Yes.</p>
                            <p>Staywell Health does not bill insurance for membership or visits, but your insurance can still be used for labs, imaging, specialists, hospital care, and emergency services.</p>
                            <p>Many labs can be drawn directly in our office for convenience. If coming to the office is not convenient, you may choose to visit a local lab instead. When labs are ordered, we submit your insurance information to the lab, and the lab bills your insurance company directly. Coverage and any out-of-pocket costs depend on your specific plan.</p>
                            <p>If prior authorization is required by your insurance for certain medications, tests, or procedures, I will handle that as part of your care.</p>

                            <p>Yes. I strongly recommend maintaining some form of coverage.</p>
                            <p>While Staywell Health can manage most primary care needs, it does not replace coverage for hospitalizations, emergency care, major imaging, or specialty procedures. Many members pair their Staywell membership with traditional insurance or a health share for broader protection.</p>

                            <p>A health share is a healthcare cost-sharing program where members contribute a monthly amount that is used to help cover eligible medical expenses.</p>
                            <p>Health shares are not insurance, but they are often more affordable and can work well for people who want coverage for large, unexpected medical events such as hospitalizations or surgeries. Coverage rules and reimbursement vary by program, so it's important to review the details carefully.</p>

                            <p>HSA and FSA cards are often accepted for medical services and sometimes for membership fees, but this depends on your specific plan. We provide detailed receipts, but reimbursement is not guaranteed. It's best to confirm eligibility with your plan administrator.</p>
